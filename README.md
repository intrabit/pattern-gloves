# pattern-gloves

This is the software for a pair of gloves that can record and match certain patterns made through the use of two physical gloves I've already built. The primary use for this technology would be to translate sign language into a written or spoken form. The project is currently in the testing and configuration phase. Once fully operational, the design of the gloves can be improved to give a smaller, more ergonomic form. The gloves are currently completely wireless and can operate several metres from the computer. All the code is written in C++. Note: This is a prototype.
